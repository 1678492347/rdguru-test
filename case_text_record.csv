20398363,ORPHA:79320,ALG6-CDG,"A 9 year old Saudi boy (Fig. 1) was referred for evaluation of psychomotor retardation, hypotonia and dilated cardiomyopathy. He was born at 40 weeks gestation after a normal pregnancy and delivery with a birth weight of 4.6 kg. Hypotonia without feeding problems was noted in the neonatal period, bilateral alternating squint at two months of age, and hypokinesia at four months of age. At one year of age, he developed febrile seizures followed by afebrile partial epilepsy that responded well to carbamazepine. At three years of age, he presented with recurrent episodes of difficulty breathing and fatigability. Chest X-ray revealed cardiac enlargement with increased pulmonary vascularity. Echocardiography showed moderate dilatation and dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). The end-systolic LV dimension was 3 (1.7-2.5 cm) corresponding to a Z-score of 4.3, while the end-diastolic LV dimension was 4.2 (2.9-3.9 cm) and the Z-score was 3.4. The ejection fraction and ejection fraction shortening were slightly subnormal at 56% and 27%, respectively. The interventricular septum thickness was normal. There was no mitral regurgitation and no pericardial effusion. These findings confirmed moderate cardiomyopathy of the dilated type. He was subsequently placed on captopril at a dose of 6.25 mg three times daily that was continued for five years. Captopril was just recently weaned off with stabilization of the cardiac function. At the age of 6 years, he was not able to sit unsupported, was nonverbal and is completely dependent on the family for care. On physical examination at the age of 7 years, the child was wheelchair bound with severe mental retardation and no speech. His head circumference and weight were on the 50 centile. His height was on the 25 centile. He had brachycephaly, bilateral esotropia, coarse hair with double hair whorl, low anterior hair line, broad nasal bridge, widely spaced eyes, prominent large ears, short philtrum, wide mouth with a thin upper lip, small teeth, widely spaced inverted nipples, bilateral cryptorchidism, reduced muscle bulk and tone with axial hypotonia. Deep tendon reflex were difficult to elicit. Finger joints were hyperextensible but knees and hips showed limited joint extension. Routine laboratory investigations showed normal urinalysis, normal complete blood count, blood glucose, thyroid and kidney function tests, serum amino acids, lactate, acylcarnitine profile, and urine organic acids. "
21129173,ORPHA:169186,Autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy,"Patient 1 is a 13 year old girl belonging to a consanguineous family from Turkey without ancestral history of neuromuscular disorders (Figure 1A-B). There were no complications during pregnancy, antenatal signs for muscle disorders as polyhydramnios and reduced fetal movements were not noted. Hypotonia was diagnosed at birth and motor development was delayed: head control was achieved at 6 months, walking at 18 months and running at 36 months. Muscle weakness was predominantly proximal, accompanied by mild facial weakness, ptosis and ophtalmoplegia/paresis. Tendinous reflexes were absent and she has no contractures. Although she has mild mental retardation (IQ 60), speech development was normal and she integrated the regular educational system. Echocardiography, electrocardiography and electroneuromyography were normal, and there were no indications of myotonia or neuromuscular junction abnormalities. Serum creatine kinase was mildly elevated [380 IU/L (70-150); normal range 60 - 320 IU/L]. She is currently walking independently but she has difficulty climbing stairs and running. Pulmonary function tests are normal. Patient 1 has one non-affected sister and none of the parents displays clinical features of a muscle disorder."
21129173,ORPHA:169186,Autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy,"Patient 2, a 14 year old boy, is the first-degree cousin of patient 1 and belongs to a second consanguineous family loop (Figure 1A-B). The course of the disease was rather similar to patient 1 with normal pregnancy, hypotonia at birth, delayed motor milestones and normal speech development despite a mild mental retardation (IQ 60). Head control was achieved at 6 months, walking at 18 months and running at 36 months. Likewise, patient 2 presents a predominantly proximal muscle weakness, absent tendinous reflexes, facial weakness, ptosis and opthalmoplegia/paresis. However, his phenotype is more severe as he is not able to walk independently since the age of 10 years and is wheelchair-bound. Furthermore, the degree of ophtalmoplegia/paresis and ptosis is more prominent than in patient 1. In addition, electrocardiography and HOLTER examination revealed premature ventricular complexes while echocardiography was normal. Serum creatine kinase was 450 IU/L (70-150) and electromyography revealed myopathic changes in all muscle groups. He needs non-invasive respiratory support for four hours per day. Patient 2 has healthy parents and 3 non-affected siblings. Whole body MRI of both patients revealed similar results with increased signals on T2 and T1 weighted images in thigh muscles, upper and lower extremities which are consistent with fatty infiltrations. Detailed axial imaging of the femoral and crural regions of patient 1 revealed prominent fatty involvement of soleus, tibialis anterior, peroneal and extensor muscles, but sparing of the gastrocnemius (Figure 1C). All thigh muscle groups were affected without selective pattern. Imaging of upper limb demonstrated relative sparing of triceps, subscapularis and flexor muscle groups (Figure 1C). No abnormalities of brain, heart or other organs were noted."
20388228,ORPHA:3109,Mayer-Rokitansky-K¨¹ster-Hauser syndrome,"A 17-year-old woman with primary amenorrhea was sent to us with a diagnosis of Rokitansky syndrome. The patient was born via normal delivery at a weight of 2400 g when her mother was 17. She was admitted to the hospital at an age of 8 days due to vomiting and moderate dystrophy; she was then diagnosed with primary right PH. She was later readmitted several times for pulmonary insufficiency. Two months later, a diagnosis of congenital right pulmonary hypoplasia with hypoplasia of the right lung artery was confirmed. In an ultrasound examination performed 7 months later, the right kidney was not observed. From more recent (at an age of 15 years) X-ray images taken of the pelvis in the Emergency Unit, the patient was also diagnosed with right hip dysplasia; this condition was initially defined as old secondary osteonecrosis of the right femoral head.The patient reported three years of genital and mammary development as well as cyclic pelvic pain for 4-5 days every month despite the primary amenorrhea. She weighed 42 kg and was 153 cm tall. The physical examination revealed normal external genital development and normal breasts. There was complete vaginal atresia. In the combined rectal examination, the pelvis was noted to be free. A transrectal ultrasound did not confirm the presence of a uterus. In this ultrasound examination, there was difficulty visualizing the ovaries; on the right side, however, vascular dilatations or multicystic embryonary remnants could be observed. The abdominal ultrasound did not show the presence of a right kidney. General and hormonal analyses were normal (FSH 3.9 mUI/mL, LH 6.2 mUI/mL, PRL 7.9 ng/mL, E2 35 pg/mL, P 0.3 ng/mL), and chest X-rays and i.v. pyelography showed right pulmonary hypoplasia, dysplasia of the right hip, and right renal agenesis with a normal left kidney and ureter (see Figure 1). Later, a conventional cytogenetic study revealed a normal female karyotype 46, XX at a level of 550 GTG bands. A CGH analysis was performed using a 244K oligoarray CGH (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), detecting 11 copy number variants (CNV) described as normal variants in the databases. Some CNVs (17q12 and 22q11.21 microdeletions) described in other MRKH patients were not present in this case. The geneticists have been studying her family history and Figure 2 shows the pedigree of the family, compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Eight months later, a new transrectal ultrasound was performed. Again, there was no evidence to suggest any functioning rudimentary uterine horn. The right ovary appeared to be normal, and there were the same vascular dilatations or multicystic remnants previously seen on the right side. The left ovary was also difficult to identify properly. The patient, who visited the clinic with her parents, wished operation and to have a neovagina created. She was therefore scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopy and creation of a neovagina according to the McIndoe technique with a prosthesis and skin graft. Laparoscopy confirmed the absence of uterus. There was a varicocele and/or retroperitoneal multicystic formations on the right side of the small pelvis. On both sides, an elongated, solid, rudimentary uterine horn could be observed. At its superior end, there were ovaries that were elongated, somewhat dysgenetic (more on the right side), and located very high in both abdominal flanks (Figure 1D). Rudimentary tubes could also be observed. Although the uterine rudimentary tract was slightly thicker on the left side, there did not appear to be even minimal endometrial cavitation of the solid uterine rudimentary horn. Sectioning and dissection from the introitum to the inside below the urethra was performed via a transperineal procedure, thus forming a wide vaginal neocavity reaching the Douglas pouch. Interestingly, the dissection of the neovaginal cavity tended more toward the left fundus than the right, as if there were more atresia on the right side of the supposed location of the vagina. A prosthesis with a skin graft taken from the right buttock was applied, with Interceed? placed between the skin and the prosthesis (Figure 3). The drawing of the genital tract of the patient generated in the surgery theater is shown in Figure 2B. After 10 days, the prosthesis was removed and the state of the neovagina was assessed. After replacement of the prosthesis, the patient was discharged. The patient returned for a follow-up visit 6 months after the operation, and her evolution was normal. She then underwent transvaginal ultrasound that did not show the ovaries properly but showed the multicystic embryonary remnants in the right hemipelvis. An uretrocystoscopy showed absence of ectopic ureter and of the right hemitrigone. Likewise, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) showed right renal agenesis with probable embryonary remnants of a disgenetic kidney in the right hemipelvis with a multicystic morphology (see Figure 4). Those cysts seem to have slightly increased in the transvaginal ultrasound, but four years after operation her evolution is normal, without symptoms and the neovagina is adequately functional."
20074341,ORPHA:157215,Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria,"A four member Spanish family is described in this report (Figure 1). Parents were not consanguineous and all members were asymptomatic. The daughter was referred to our outpatient clinic at the age of 11 years for evaluation of hyperphosphatasia and hypercalciuria. She had been suffering of intermittent abdominal pain for 3 years but denied bone pain or renal colic. At the first evaluation her height was 153.3 cm (50th percentile) and her weight 44.5 kg (50th percentile), normal blood pressure (116/60 mm Hg) and the only abnormal finding in the physical examination was a mild dorsal scoliosis. The initial serum biochemistry in our clinic confirmed the previous biochemical alterations and showed decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) and high circulating levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. Acid-base status and serum urea, creatinine, albumin, lipid profile and liver-function tests were normal. Bilateral medullar nephrocalcinosis was found by renal ultrasonography. No radiological signs of rickets were present, bone mineral density was within normal reference values and bone age was according to chronological age. Oral phosphate supplementation was prescribed but only for a short period because of patient's bad compliance and lack of major disease-related manifestations. Significant biochemical findings of the patient and her family are shown in Table 1. Renal ultrasound of the parents and brother were normal. After a 7.5 year follow up, the four family members continue asymptomatic and their initial laboratory alterations remain essentially unchanged."
18154657,ORPHA:64,Alstr?m syndrome,"In 2002, the 27-year old proband was referred to the lipid clinic of a tertiary health care centre for evaluation of an elevated triglyceride (TG) level of 59.1 mmol/L. Her prior history included poor vision since birth, commencing with the development of night blindness, eventually resulting in legal blindness by the age of 17. She had undergone a left nephrectomy at the age of 24 for a perinephric abscess due to chronic pyelonephritis. Ultrasound evaluation revealed a normal-sized right kidney with evidence of cortical scarring. Hypertension and diabetes subsequently developed at the ages of 25 and 26 years, respectively. She experienced learning difficulties in school, but did not have sensorineural deafness. On physical examination, there was evidence of central obesity with her body mass index (BMI) being 34.9 kg/m2. Her blood pressure on antihypertensive treatment was 132/86 with a regular pulse of 80 beats per minute. There was no evidence of poly- or syndactyly suggestive of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Hirsutism was present on the face, abdomen, and arms. Ophthalmologic examination was notable for retinitis pigmentosa and cataracts bilaterally."
30514338,ORPHA:1452,Cleidocranial dysplasia,"A 16 year old female came for an orthodontic consultation in March, 2008 with chief complains of crossbite and failure of eruption of permanent dentition. Intraoral examination showed a mixed dentition with Class III malocclusion. The overjet was -3?mm, overbite was ??7?mm and the midlines were centered with no notable shift. The panoramic radiograph revealed congenitally missing one lower incisor, the ectopic localization of permanent teeth, cysts formation involving the mandibular premolars, and the presence of 7 supernumerary teeth (1 in the maxilla and 6 in the mandible). The lateral radiograph confirmed a skeletal Class III malocclusion caused by mandibular hyperplasia and rotation with a horizontal growth (ANB?=???1¡ã; Wits?=???0.3?mm; FMA?=?20.2¡ã). This patient was diagnosed with cleidocranial dysplasia based on the presence of pathognomonic appearance, hypoplasia of clavicles, failure of permanent teeth eruption, and multiple supernumerary teeth."
18611256,ORPHA:14,Abetalipoproteinemia,"A 46 year old female of Northern European descent (patient 1 in reference [7] and patient 27 in Additional file 1) was diagnosed with ABL at age 11, when she presented with right ptosis. Medical work-up revealed acanthocytosis on peripheral blood smear, which at the time was pathognomonic for a diagnosis of ABL. Her ptosis was corrected surgically. In retrospect, she had a history of diarrhea in infancy that resolved upon fat restriction. She was noted to have ataxia and paresthesia in a glove-and-stocking distribution in her teenage years. She was started on high oral doses of fat-soluble vitamins approximately 9 years after her diagnosis. In 1999, the molecular basis of her condition was found to be a homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 13 of MTP due to a single nucleotide base-pair deletion (c.1820delG) [7].  At age 26 she married. At age 34, she gave birth to a full-term healthy male infant. During her pregnancy, she was advised to stop all intake of vitamin A to avoid the potential risk of vitamin A teratogenicity, despite the fact that her serum beta-carotene concentration was below the lower limit of the normal range. Postpartum, she developed a right corneal ulcer that required corneal transplantation after a year. She was restarted on vitamin A postpartum. Her corneal transplant failed and currently she is waiting for a repeat right corneal transplant. Of note, she was not able to achieve a second pregnancy despite multiple attempts. Her past medical history included scalp basal cell carcinoma successfully treated with cryotherapy. She also had a long history of oligomenorrhea. Subjectively, her symptoms had otherwise remained stable for decades. Her parents were first cousins. Her family history included two sisters with Alport syndrome. There was no family history of ABL.  She was followed yearly and evaluated in 2007, 34 years after her initial diagnosis. Her medications included vitamin K 10 mg twice a week, calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily, beta-carotene 40,000 IU daily, vitamin A 10,000 IU daily, vitamin E 400 IU daily, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, calcium, magnesium and eye drops.  On physical exam her weight was 56.5 kg. She had mild bilateral scleral icterus. Cranial nerve exam was normal apart from decreased visual acuity on the right side. The gait was wide-based. Romberg test was positive but she had no dysmetria and no dysdiadochokinesia. Sensory exam was remarkable for decreased vibration sense in upper and lower limbs and decreased position sense in the lower limbs. Pain sensation was normal. Motor exam showed normal tone and power in major muscle groups with absent knee reflexes. The Babinski sign was negative. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable, specifically the heart rhythm was regular and there was no evidence of congestive heart failure. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Lab evaluation included a normal white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin concentration, normal mean red blood cell volume with a slightly elevated reticulocyte count at 112 ¡Á 109/L (normal 10 to 100 ¡Á 109/L). The blood film showed acanthocytosis (Figure 1). Serum concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D and ionized calcium were normal. Serum vitamin E was low at <5 ¦Ìmol/L (normal 18¨C29 ¦Ìmol/L). International normalized ratio of prothrombin time was normal at 1.1. Total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 27.7 ¦Ìmol/L (normal 3.4¨C17.1 ¦Ìmol/L), while direct bilirubin, serum transaminases, gammaglutaryl transferase, albumin and total protein were normal. Serum creatine kinase was elevated at 211 mmol/L (normal 26¨C140 mmol/L). Serum thyrotrophin, progesterone and 17-OH-progesterone were within normal limits for age and sex. No changes in treatment were recommended."
18611256,ORPHA:14,Abetalipoproteinemia,"In 1976, a 16-year old girl presented with progressively worsening coordination. During infancy, her persistent diarrhea resolved with the institution of a low-fat diet. At age 11, routine blood tests revealed acanthocytosis with undetectable plasma cholesterol and triglyceride, which together with normal parental lipid profiles suggested a diagnosis of ABL. Oral vitamin A 25 000 IU daily, 25-hydroxy vitamin D 10 000 IU daily, and vitamin K 5 mg daily were prescribed. At age 16, she began to experience generalized weakness and impaired balance. Neurological examination revealed mild dysarthria, reduced muscle bulk, bilateral proximal muscle weakness, absent deep-tendon reflexes, upgoing plantar reflexes, reduced sensitivity to light touch with loss of proprioception and vibration sense in a glove-and-stocking distribution, mild intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia in upper and lower limbs, a wide-based ataxic gait and positive Romberg sign [8]. Evoked motor unit potentials in the right extensor digitorum brevis were decreased (30% of the lower limit of normal) and electron microscopy of the sural nerve showed a marked reduction in large myelinated fibres [8]. Plasma creatine kinase was 314 IU/L (normal <45 IU/L). Plasma triglycerides and cholesterol were markedly decreased (1.8 [normal 5.2] and <0.1 [normal 1.3] mmol/L, respectively) while VLDL and LDL fractions were absent on lipoprotein electrophoresis. Plasma, erythrocyte and adipose tissue vitamin E levels were undetectable. Vitamin E deficiency was diagnosed. High-dose oral vitamin E therapy at 800 mg/day was added to her treatment in 1981, and was progressively titrated to her current dose of 14 400 IU (220 IU/kg)."
30241551,ORPHA:538,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"A 33-year-old female nonsmoker with a 4-month history of intermittent chest pain and dyspnea at rest, which recurred every 2 weeks, was admitted to our hospital at 31 weeks of gestation. Four months ago, she had been admitted after experiencing these symptoms for the first time. A chest radiograph at that time revealed left hydropneumothorax with 90% lung compression. The patient received closed chest tube drainage (CTD). However, left pneumothorax recurred during rest or minimal activity in the 20th, 25th, 28th, and 30th weeks of gestation. For every recurrent episode, she was admitted to a local hospital, where she received CTD and was discharged only after radiographic confirmation that the pneumothorax had completely resolved. At the current admission, arterial blood gas analysis indicated type I respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 51 mmHg. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen and continuous CTD. Between the 31st and 32nd weeks of gestation, abdominal ultrasound revealed that the umbilical cord was twisted around the neck of the fetus. At 33rd weeks, the patient underwent a cesarean section and successfully delivered a baby with a low birth weight of 1720 g and normal Apgar scores. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed small, thin-walled cystic lesions diffused throughout all lung fields. The serum level of vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D) was 6608 pg/ml. The patient was diagnosed with LAM, and she began treatment at a dose of 2 mg/day from 28 days after delivery. At 18 months after treatment initiation, the patient¡¯s exercise capacity and quality of life exhibited considerable improvement, and she was able to resume work. She was followed up for 3 years and had not experienced recurrent pneumothorax at the time of writing this report. She could perform all daily activities, including jogging, housekeeping, and routine work. The only sirolimus-associated adverse effect was mucositis, which gradually ameliorated and resolved with time during the course of sirolimus treatment. A follow-up pulmonary function test (PFT) revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.20 l (75.3% predicted), FEV1 of 1.85 l (66.3% predicted), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 84.1% (100% predicted). Moreover, she could cover a distance of 480 m in a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Her baby showed normal growth and remained healthy without breast milk."
30241551,ORPHA:538,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"A 23-year-old female nonsmoker was admitted to our hospital with 6 days of dyspnea. The chest radiograph revealed bilateral hydropneumothoraces (50% and 80% compression in the left and right lungs, respectively). Two months ago, a large intraperitoneal mass had been detected during prenatal examination, and the patient underwent laparatomy with abdominal mass resection and left nephrectomy. Postoperative pathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining demonstrated that the renal mass consisted of malformed blood vessels, fusiform smooth muscle bundles, and adipose tissue. Immunohistochemical staining revealed positive expression of human melanoma black 45 (HMB45), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34). She underwent bilateral CTD and when her lungs markedly re-expanded, chest HRCT was performed and revealed multiple, diffuse, round, thin-walled cysts in both lungs. TSC gene mutation was not seen. The patient opted for a conservative management strategy with observation and intermittent supplemental oxygen administration after complete resolution of the pneumothorax. However, 4 months later, the patient developed left followed by right pneumothorax. She was hospitalized for over 30 days, and after complete resolution of the pneumothoraces, she began sirolimus treatment. The plasma sirolimus level was maintained at 4¨C5 ng/ml in repeated measurements. The patient was followed for >?1 year without pneumothorax recurrence, and she could perform all types of ordinary exercises, including running, mountain climbing, cycling, housekeeping, and other outdoor activities. The only sirolimus-associated adverse effect was a mildly intermittent menstruation disorder. A follow-up PFT revealed an FVC of 2.08 l (61% predicted), an FEV1 of 2.04 l (70% predicted), an FEV1/FVC ratio of 98% (87% predicted), a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.70 mmol/kPa/min (75% predicted), and a total lung capacity of 3.13 l (68% predicted). She could cover a distance of 550 m in 6MWT. However, the patient discontinued sirolimus after 1.5 years without seeking advice from her physicians because she was planning to conceive for the second time. Three months later, she presented with left chest pain and an uncomfortable feeling in her chest on movement. She received supplemental oxygen support at home for 5 days, following which a chest radiograph revealed left pneumothorax with 30% lung compression. Over the next 2 months, she experienced two episodes of right pneumothorax. She was hospitalized again and remained unable to work or perform regular activities."
30241551,ORPHA:538,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"A 31-year-old female nonsmoker presented with chest pain and dyspnea at rest. Chest HRCT revealed right pneumothorax with 90% lung compression and multiple bilateral pulmonary bullae. The patient received CTD and oxygen supplementation, followed by bullectomy in the right upper lung lobe. Postoperative H&E staining of lung tissue revealed small spindle-shaped cells distributed alongside bronchioles, blood vessels, and lymph vessels. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positive expression of HMB45, SMA, estrogen receptor (ER; 80%), and progesterone receptor (PR; 80%). Considering her age and the fact that it was her first episode of pneumothorax, sirolimus therapy was not initiated. During the following 6 months, the patient presented with unilateral pneumothorax with 30% lung compression and was unable to resume work, and she expressed concern about the recurrence. Nine months later, she was readmitted with bilateral pneumothoraces (compression of the right and left lungs: 95% and 70%, respectively). She successively received supplemental oxygen support, CTD, and left chemical pleurodesis with 50 ml high-sugar +?5-ml lidocaine infusion and autologous blood for sclerification. Eventually, the chest tube was successfully removed, and the patient opted to begin sirolimus treatment at 2 mg/day. Follow-up plasma sirolimus levels ranged from 6 to 10 ng/ml. At the time of writing this report, the patient had been followed up for 2.5 years without recurrence, had resumed her job, and was able to perform ordinary exercises, including jogging, running, mountain climbing, and badminton. A follow-up PFT revealed an FVC of 2.24 l (72.7% predicted), FEV1 of 2.23 l (73.6% predicted), and FEV1/FVC ratio of 99% (118% predicted), and she could cover a distance of 555 m in 6MWT."
30241551,ORPHA:538,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"A 38-year-old female nonsmoker with an 8-year history of recurrent dyspnea and hemoptysis, which had been aggravated since a week, was admitted to our hospital. She had experienced right chest pain and mild dyspnea following a sneeze 8 years ago, and chest radiography at that time confirmed right pneumothorax. Chest HRCT revealed bilateral, diffuse, round, thin-walled cysts with varying sizes. She was clinically diagnosed with tuberculosis and received anti-tuberculosis therapy for 6 months. Two years later, the patient underwent pleurodesis under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) because of recurrent pnuemothoraces and for further evaluation of the thin-walled cystic lesions. Postoperative pathological examination of lung tissue revealed the characteristics of pulmonary LAM. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated positive expression of HMB45, SMA, ER, and PR. Over the next 3 years, she experienced recurrent pneumothorax, mainly in the right lung. At the current admission, the chest radiograph revealed right pneumothorax with 60% lung compression. Two days later, the patient exhibited severe dyspnea with cyanotic lips and nails, and unconsciousness. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed type I respiratory failure with a PaO2 of 45.5 mmHg, while a chest radiograph showed massive bilateral pneumothoraces. On resolution of the pneumothoraces, the patient opted to begin sirolimus treatment at 2 mg/day. She was diagnosed with recurrent tuberculosis at the same time, and anti-tuberculosis therapy was also initiated. The plasma sirolimus level was 3.9 ng/ml. Following anti-tuberculosis treatment for 1 year, her respiratory symptoms completely resolved, and the treatment was discontinued. One month later, she presented with swollen, painful ankles and fingers. The plasma sirolimus level at that time was >?15 ng/ml. The findings of rheumatological and immunological examinations were unremarkable. The ankle and finger pain was considered a side effect of sirolimus treatment; therefore, the dose was reduced to 1 mg/day. The ankle pain resolved; however, the patient developed slight fever, and clinical examinations revealed that the tuberculosis had relapsed. Accordingly, anti-tuberculosis therapy was restarted. Four months later, she experienced recurrent dyspnea and right pneumothorax; the plasma sirolimus level was 0.01 ng/ml. The sirolimus dose was increased to 2 mg/day, and she additionally received supplemental oxygen support. Two months later, the plasma sirolimus level was 2.97 ng/ml, and a chest radiograph revealed complete resolution of the pneumothorax. Sirolimus-associated side effects included mild mucositis, joint pain, and menoxenia. At the time of writing this report, the patient had been followed up for >?3 years, with gradually improved respiratory symptoms. She exhibited an improved quality of life and was able to perform daily activities such as housework, jogging, cycling, and mountain climbing. A follow-up PFT revealed an FVC of 3.39 l (120.2% predicted), FEV1 of 2.38 l (90.5% predicted), and FEV1/FVC ratio of 70.2% (86.2% predicted). The distance covered in 6MWT was 510 m."
30241551,ORPHA:538,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"A 30-year-old female smoker presented with a 3-year history of recurrent pneumothorax, chest pain, and dyspnea on exercise. Chest CT obtained after the first episode of pneumothorax 3 years ago revealed left pneumothorax with 50% lung compression and bilateral, multiple, thin-walled pulmonary cysts. The patient underwent left pulmonary bullectomy and intrapleural fixation. However, the patient still experienced frequent left or right pneumothorax at rest or on minimal activity, although it showed spontaneous resolution. A year ago, the patient was admitted to a local hospital with severe pain in the right chest and dyspnea. A chest radiograph revealed right pneumothorax with 30% lung compression. She also developed recurrent lower abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple retroperitoneal cystic masses (15.6?¡Á?20.2 cm), a cystic mass at the right uterine attachment (6.2?¡Á?3.6?¡Á?7.0 cm). She underwent retroperitoneal tumor resection, and postoperative pathological examination of the retroperitoneal mass revealed a large number of spindle-shaped cells distributed alongside blood vessels and lymph vessels. The cells showed no obvious heterotypic features, necrosis, and mitosis. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated positive expression of SMA, HMB45, ER, PR, and D2¨C40. The serum VEGF-D level was 2685.88 pg/ml. Considering the possibility of recurrent pneumothorax, the patient agreed to begin sirolimus therapy at 1 mg/day. At the time of writing this report, the patient had been followed up for 5 months without recurrent pneumothorax or abdominal pain. A follow-up PFT revealed an FVC of 3.12 l (93.6% predicted), an FEV1 of 2.35 l (81.4% predicted), an FEV1/FVC ratio of 75.54% (84.06% predicted), a DLCO of 5.35 ?mmol/kPa/min (61.4% predicted), and a total lung capacity of 4.31 l (93% predicted). The plasma sirolimus levels in the first and third months of treatment were 5.28 and 7.25 ng/ml, respectively. The distance covered in 6MWT was 480 m. Mild mucositis was the only sirolimus-associated adverse effect."
26860746,ORPHA:1667,Wolcott-Rallison syndrome,"This female patient, now aged 21 years, presented with antibody negative (Islet Cell / Glutamic Acid decarboxylase) diabetes mellitus aged 6 months. Her parents are White British and unrelated. At 3 years of age, she developed acute liver failure, encephalopathy and renal dysfunction during a minor febrile illness. She recovered completely except for residual cerebellar signs (dysarthria, ataxia). Progressive growth failure developed from 3¨C4 years of age prompting assessment of pituitary function which did not reveal any abnormality. Hand radiography revealed acro-osteolysis of distal phalanges 1,3 and 5 and the dysplastic carpal bones. Subsequent skeletal survey confirmed multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with hip subluxation and extensive calcification of soft tissues around the knee joints. WRS was confirmed on genetic testing which revealed compound heterozygosity for a frameshift mutation c.577delA and a missense mutation R632W (c.1966C?>?T) in exons 3 and 12 of the E1F2AK3 gene, (previously reported [8].  Aged 11 years, worsening gait, lower limb pain, reduced mobility and evolution of upper motor neurone long tract signs led to radiological evaluation of cervical anatomy. Neuroimaging revealed an Os Odontoideum with spinal cord compression (Fig. 1a). Imaging of the neck showed normal position of the C1 anterior vertebral body and C2 main body with absence of ossification of the main body of the odontoid peg (Fig. 1a). The odontoid peg tip was normally sited in relation to the C1 vertebra but had become distracted from the main body of C2. The posterior body of C1 was normally positioned and readily visible in the sagittal view (Fig. 1a). The patient underwent successful occipito-cervical fusion to preserve the spinal canal and alleviate bone pressure on the spinal cord (fixation with pedicle screws into C2 and subaxial lateral mass screws and decompression with removal of the C1 lamina), (Fig. 1 b and c). The patient made an uneventful recovery from surgery with improvement of her myelopathic symptoms and signs."
26860746,ORPHA:1667,Wolcott-Rallison syndrome,"This male patient presented with diabetes mellitus and concurrent acute hepatic and renal dysfunction at 11 months of age. Detailed clinical and molecular genetic findings confirming the diagnosis of WRS is published elsewhere but he was found to have a homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 9 (c.1635_1638delGAAA) of EIF2KA3 [8]. The diagnosis of Os odontoideum in case 1 prompted imaging in this patient at 9 years of age. The sagittal MRI view confirmed lack of ossification of the odontoid peg (Fig. 2). Imaging did not identify AAI and without clinically apparent neurological consequences of the odontoid abnormality and therefore, a conservative approach to management was adopted. The patient unfortunately died at the age of 12 years from acute liver failure. Radiological image from Case 2. Midline sagittal T2w image demonstrates lack of ossification of the dens"
26860746,ORPHA:1667,Wolcott-Rallison syndrome,"Case 3, aged 14.5 years at the most recent assessment has previously been reported in a case series when 4 years old [9]. He is the youngest of five siblings from consanguineous Pakistani parents. His oldest sister also has WRS and both carry the same homozygous missense mutation in EIF2AK3 (c.1832G?>?A, R587Q) [2].  He presented aged 10 weeks with an upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting and hyperglycaemia. His diabetes remains poorly controlled with HbA1c persistently greater than 8 %. He was noted to have elevated liver enzymes and percutaneous liver biopsy showed progressive fibrosing intrahepatic cholestasis. Skeletal radiography revealed dysplastic femoral epiphyses.  At 3.8 years, he presented with encephalitis associated with significant loss of gross and fine motor skills, acute hepatitis and consistent EEG findings. Over the next 4 years his motor development improved, although remained delayed. He became wheelchair bound aged 7 years when imaging identified a 12 mm anterior translation of C1 on C2 flexion (Fig. 3a) He was initially managed conservatively with a cervical hard collar. MRI scan (Fig. 3b) confirmed AAI and over the next 3 years, neuro-surgical opinions repeatedly recommended surgical fixation. The family declined to follow this advice because of concerns regarding surgical risk despite progressive deterioration both on MRI and clinical assessment of upper and lower limb neurological signs, (reduced power and increased tone). Aged 11.9 years, he presented in cardio-respiratory arrest secondary to spinal cord injury. He was resuscitated successfully and underwent surgical C1-C2 posterior fixation (Fig. 3c). Following surgery, he was paraplegic and required long-term home ventilation. He died aged 15 years following an episode of acute liver failure."
26860746,ORPHA:1667,Wolcott-Rallison syndrome,"This male patient is now 4 years of age and the younger sibling of case 2. He had the same homozygous mutation (c.1635_1638delGAAA) of EIF2KA3. He presented aged 4 months of age with abnormal liver enzymes typical of WRS and diabetes. Due to his brother¡¯s diagnosis he was tested for WRS and found to have the same mutation. His diabetes is controlled well on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. He has had recurrent episodes of acute liver dysfunction. Aged 3.5 years he developed right-sided focal seizures associated with left hemisphere focal epileptiform discharge on EEG and some evidence of cerebral atrophy in the left hemisphere. These are improving on anti-epileptic medication (ethosuximide, levetiracetam and clobazam). Cranioverterbral imaging showed os odontodium to be present, but with no instability on flexion-extension x-rays. Present management is conservative, as with his brother in view of the lack of AAI."

The birth weight was 4,170 g (>97th centile) and length was 54.5 cm (>97th centile). Head and renal ultrasounds were normal at birth and a normal 46,XY karyotype was reported. By 4 months of age he had had two minor operations to remove the extra digits and reduce the cutaneous syndactyly. We saw patient G5-1 at age 3 years and again for follow up at age 9 years. On examination at 3 years of age, his OFC was 56.8 cm (>97th centile). A prominent forehead and metopic ridging were present, as well as a prominent occiput (Fig. 1A). The palpebral fissures were slightly downslanting and the ears were normally shaped. Inner canthal distance was normal (2.8 cm, +1 SD), but interpupillary distance was 5.5 cm (?97th centile, Fig. 1B). Broad thumbs and fifth digit clinodactyly were noted, as well as pes planus and a broad right great toe (Fig. 1C,D). The cranial CT was normal. The father had normal hands and feet, but an OFC of 58.5 cm (>97th centile). Maternal history was non-contributory and she did not have clinical features of GCPS. Sequencing of GLI3 in the proband revealed a frameshift mutation (c.4402insG) [Johnston et al., 2005]. Parental GLI3 sequences were normal. We assessed this patient as having a typical or classical presentation of GCPS."

18241058,ORPHA:380,Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome,"G7-1 is the most severely affected patient presented here. She was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy with clubbed feet and preaxial polydactyly of the feet. Her birth weight was 4,143 g (?90th centile) and length was 53.3 cm (50th¨C75th centile). Whereas the aforementioned patients had normal growth and development, patient G7-1 had DD, primarily speech delays, with some motor and cognitive delays. She began walking at 3.5 years of age and speaking at 2 years. At 6 years, she began speaking in sentences and started special education classes at 7 years of age. She was eventually mainstreamed into regular classes by high school and maintained grades varying from A to D. She also had an atypical seizure disorder which started at 11 years of age. A previous karyotype was normal, 46,XX. We evaluated her at 17 years of age. Her weight was 67 kg (75th¨C90th centile), her height was 153 cm (?10th centile) and her OFC was 57 cm (>97th centile for 16-year-old). She had mild bitemporal narrowing and a prominent forehead. Her inner canthal distance was 3.0 cm (?mean for a 16-year-old) and her outer canthal distance was 9.2 cm (Fig. 8A,B) She did not have apparent hypertelorism. Reflexes were mildly brisk, 3+, and bilateral, unsustained clonus was elicited. The hands were hyperextensible both in the fingers and wrists. The right thumb was broad and slightly shorter than the left, with moderate clinodactyly of the left second finger (Fig. 8C). The feet were short (right 19.5 cm and left 20.0 cm, <3rd centile), and the dorsal aspect of the feet had surgical scars (Fig. 8D). The toes were all deviated medially, and she had some difficulty with heel to toe walking. She was able to respond to simple questions but did not elaborate. Hand and foot X-rays showed deformities with additional bone on the medial side of both feet between the distal tarsal bones in the base of the first and second metatarsals. An EEG was positive for bilateral epileptiform discharges with photoparoxysmal response and the MRI revealed mild cerebral atrophy, but was otherwise normal. This patient recently gave birth to a child with polydactyly and cutaneous syndactyly and hypertelorism, although we have not evaluated him. The family has no other history of polydactyly.

Despite the fact that the patient presented signs of HP from birth, the diagnosis was only establish at 2 years of age, following the loss of his anterior deciduous teeth. Molecular testing was done at 31 years of age. At birth, the patient was diagnosed with craniosynostosis, multiple fractures and had bone pain, which required several operative procedures. All primary teeth were lost by the age of 8 years, but his permanent dentition is still present at 36 years of age."
19232125,ORPHA:436,Hypophosphatasia,"The boy was referred to the Paediatric Department of the H?pitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg at 9 years of age. He has the infantile form of HP which was diagnosed at birth. He had experienced multiple fractures and craniosynostosis. Currently, he is confined to a wheelchair. Screening for the HP mutations was performed to confirm the diagnosis. At 9 years of age, he has already lost all mandibular primary teeth except the right lower first molar (84). The maxillary primary central incisors and second primary molars (51, 61, 55 and 65) had also been prematurely exfoliated. Currently, the patient is in the mixed dentition stage. The primary teeth still present are the maxillary lateral incisors, the maxillary canines, the maxillary first molars and the right lower first molar (52, 53, 54, 62, 63, 64 and 84), the permanent teeth present are the maxillary left central incisor, all four lower incisors and all first molars (21, 31, 32, 41, 42, 16, 26, 36 and 46)."

The patient's history reported normal growth. Except the absence of the central lower mandibular incisors, the oral examination was entirely normal, without inflammation of the gums. Thus, the child was referred to the geneticist for diagnosis of suspected HP. Medical findings showed a slight delay in growth. Radiographs of the skeleton demonstrated general undermineralization of bones while biochemical investigations revealed a low level of serum AP and an urinary excretion of phosphoethanolamine, one of the substrates of the enzyme. Molecular analysis revealed 2 mutations on the ALPL gene and confirmed the diagnosis of a childhood subtype of HP. Today, at 4.5 years of age, the patient has lost all primary incisors, the lower primary canines and the upper right canine (51, 52, 53, 61, 62, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82 and 83). The lower first primary molars (74 and 84) are also very mobile. She also reports some difficulty in running and has bone pain."
19232125,ORPHA:436,Hypophosphatasia,"The proband had her first visit at 1 year of age at the Paediatric Department of the University of Nancy Faculty of Dentistry. Her mother worried about the spontaneous loss of the lower right primary central incisor tooth (81). Although, the rest of the oral examination was normal, a diagnosis of HP was considered. At first, the laboratory assays did not show any abnormalities; the initial value of serum AP was normal (224 UI/L), and the diagnosis of HP was excluded. In the next two years, the patient lost 3 other primary teeth. The girl also complained of pain in her lower limbs. New laboratory investigations were made and revealed a low value of serum AP (67 UI/L); normal values range for children from 123¨C283 UI/L. Molecular biology established the diagnosis of a childhood form of HP afterwards. At 4 years of age, she had already lost all her lower primary incisors (71, 72, 81 and 82)."
19232125,ORPHA:436,Hypophosphatasia,"A 30-months-old boy was referred by a paediatric dentist because of the premature loss of primary teeth.

At 19 months of age, this child had spontaneously lost his four lower primary incisors (71, 72, 81 and 82) and the upper left primary incisors and canine (61, 62 and 63) following trauma. The oral examination did not reveal any gingivitis or bleeding. The patient was referred to the Department of Medical Genetics with suspected HP. Despite a normal growth pattern, radiographs of the skeleton revealed a distorted bone trabeculation with areas of decreased radiolucency and slightly deficient bone undermineralization. Biochemical data revealed a low level serum AP. Molecular biology investigations showed one mutation on ALPL gene and confirmed the diagnosis of childhood HP. Today, at 6 years of age, the boy has lost all his mandibular and maxillary primary incisors and canines."
26051373,ORPHA:478,Kallmann syndrome,"The proband of this family (Fig. 1a) was a 32-year-old woman who consulted for infertility. She had breast development at the age of 12.5 years and menarche at 14.5 years. On consulting for oligomenorrhea (4 menstrual bleeds per year) at the age of 18, she was prescribed a combined oral contraceptive, without an etiological work-up, and subsequently had regular menses. Wishing to become pregnant, she stopped using contraception at 29 years of age. Oligomenorrhea recurred and she failed to conceive despite regular intercourse and her partner¡¯s normal sperm count. She then consulted a gynecologist who prescribed her clomiphene citrate. After four rounds of treatment, which led to neither ovulation nor pregnancy, she was referred to our department for an Endocrine consultation. During the interview she noted no sense of smell (anosmia) that was also present in her maternal grandfather. In addition, she reported poor hearing as well as absent premolars and wisdom teeth."
26051373,ORPHA:478,Kallmann syndrome,"At delivery, the newborn¡¯s weight and length were normal (weight of 3830 g and a length of 50 cm), but he had micropenis (15 mm;-3SD), descended testes and bilateral testicular hypoplasia (mean testicular volume 0.33 ml (sonography); ?3SD). Hormone assays done at age 1 month showed low [31, 40] circulating gonadotropins (FSH: 0.18 (normal range: 0.2¨C3.5); LH: 0.04 IU/L (0.5¨C6.5)), testosterone (0.1 (0.5¨C4.8)) and low testicular peptide levels (inhibin B 24 pg/mL (75¨C575); AMH 69 ng/mL (80¨C154)), confirming the diagnosis of congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism [31, 40]. Molecular studies done at birth showed that he carried the same KAL1 mutation as his mother and maternal uncle. Postnatal sonography follow-up confirmed the left renal agenesis and compensatory right kidney hypertrophy (see Additional file 1: Figure S1), together with bilateral agenesis of the olfactory bulbs on MRI at age 4 months. Synkinesia (mirror movements) were also evident and given the frequent association of KAL1 mutations and hearing loss, additional evaluation at 1 year of age was conducted revealing deafness in the child [1, 2, 19, 21, 41]. This early diagnosis enabled timely prosthetic treatment to improve the sensory deficit. In addition, in view of the severe reproductive phenotype with micropenis [31], and with approval from our local ethics committee, we proposed to treat the infant with recombinant human gonadotrophins for inducing phallus growth and testicular development [31]. Both parents gave their written consent. Notably, the mother reported a major factor in her decision was her brother¡¯s experience who also had severe KS (cryptorchidism and micropenis) and struggled with sexual disorders and infertility that were not corrected by testosterone treatment or long term combined gonadotropin therapy."

In childhood, she had a history of learning difficulties and attention-deficit behaviors without hyperactivity. She had a long history of arthralgias and limb contractures. She had generalized hyperpigmentation, noted in infancy and followed by the appearance of widespread hypopigmented macules persisting into adulthood. She had a history of multiple dental infections in childhood and severe periodontitis at the age of 36?years, but no other history suggestive of immunodeficiency. There was no history of bleeding. Physical examination revealed generalized hyperpigmentation with widespread small hypopigmented macules and patches distributed over her entire body. She had age-appropriate hair graying. She was wheelchair-bound, and exhibited bradykinesia, hypomimia, hypophonia, pseudobulbar affect, cerebellar ataxia, ocular dysmetria, spasticity and motor weakness with near plegia in the lower limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the lower limbs but hyperactive in the upper limbs. Neuropsychologic testing revealed a mild dementia syndrome. Neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation demonstrated decreased color vision and contrast sensitivity. There was myopic astigmatism bilaterally. There was severe optic nerve pallor and peripheral patchy retinal hypopigmentation bilaterally. Goldmann perimetry revealed central loss.

Examination demonstrated leg weakness with cognitive impairment, cerebellar ataxia, and parkinsonian features including mild rigidity, bradykinesia, masked facies, and hypophonia. Gait showed reduced stride length and reduced arm swing bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically reduced. Similar to the proband, he had learning disability and attention-deficit without hyperactivity during childhood. A trial of levodopa-carbidopa initially provided subjective benefit, but caused light-headedness and was later discontinued. Examination did not change. Selegiline reportedly improved the patient¡¯s activity levels and caused a subjective reduction in tremor.  Trihexyphenidyl resulted in subjective improvements in rigidity, bradykinesia, and sialorrhea, although physical examination remained essentially unchanged. There was no graying of the hair. Funduscopy revealed mild optic nerve pallor, right congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium and left choroidal nevus. Visual acuity was normal, but contrast sensitivity was reduced.

There was also evidence of hypoxic-ischemic damage."
29330883,ORPHA:494344,RERE-related neurodevelopmental syndrome,"Subject 8 is an 8-year, 3-month-old female of European descent. A truncus arteriosus type I defect was identified prenatally along with intrauterine growth retardation and fetal hand posturing. She was born at 39 1/7 weeks gestation by emergency cesarean section because of decreased fetal heart tones. Apgar scores were 1 and 6. Birth weight was 2.415 kg (3rd centile), length was 47 cm (13th centile) and OFC was 32 cm (6th centile). She was subsequently diagnosed with bilateral choanal atresia, right-sided chorioretinal and iris coloboma, and anisometropia. She underwent repair of her truncus arteriosus at 1 month of age. Following surgery, she had neonatal supraventricular tachycardia, which resolved by 1 year of age. She has progressive sensorineural hearing loss and wears a hearing aid in the left ear and has a cochlear implant on the right side. A temporal bone CT scan showed bilateral cochlear dysplasia. She has been diagnosed with developmental delay and intellectual disability. She has no speech and cannot stand or walk without assistance. She has short stature with advanced bone age and has been diagnosed with neuromuscular thoracolumbar scoliosis, bilateral hip dysplasia, and bilateral equinus contractures. At 8 years, 3 months of age, her height was 114.3 cm (0.4th centile), her weight was 20.4 kg (4th centile), and her OFC was 47 cm (<1st centile). She had a flattened facial profile, hypertelorism, a right-sided iris coloboma, normally set ears with very small lobules and prominent antihelices, a broad nasal bridge, a III/VI systolic murmur and bilateral hockey stick palmar creases."

She has a twin brother who is healthy and an older brother who was diagnosed with dyslexia but is otherwise healthy. She has been diagnosed with developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Her parents report erratic behavior, extreme separation anxiety, and difficulty falling asleep and remaining asleep. At her most recent physical examination, her height and weight were at the 95th centile and her head circumference was at the 50th centile. She was found to have hirsutism affecting the back and arms, synophrys, hypertelorism, an upturned nose, and a wide mouth."
10851256,ORPHA:42665,Tietz syndrome,"Tassabehji et al 5 and Amielet al 6 have described a mother and son who also had a mutation in the basic region ofMITF at the nearby amino acid position 217. This is the only other reported family with a mutation in the basic region, and they also did not have WS2. Both patients were congenitally deaf and the woman had generalised depigmentation with reddish freckles and reddish hair which became grey-blonde at the age of 18. At 18 months of age, her son had auburn hair. Both had lack of retinal pigmentation. Although the degree of hypopigmentation is not identical to the phenotype in the present family, this phenotype was felt by the authors to be closest to Tietz syndrome. The finding of anMITF mutation in our family would confirm that diagnosis."

29110636,ORPHA:857,Townes-Brocks syndrome,"The proband, VMFS, who was 5 years old at the time this report was written, was born by normal vaginal delivery at 38.5 weeks gestational age with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 (first and fifth minutes, respectively). His birth weight (2.735 kg), length (48 cm), and head circumference (34.5 cm) were within normal ranges. The pregnancy occurred with no intercurrences and no concerns were raised in prenatal examinations. The child was born with anal atresia, which was corrected by posterior sagittal anorretoplasty on his second day of life. After the operation, VMFS remained hospitalized for 10 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. VMFS is the second child of non-consanguineous healthy young adult parents. He has a brother (11 years old) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a cousin who was born with an imperforate anus. The patient has exhibited developmental and speech delays. He displays hyperactive and sometimes aggressive behavior, which has been managed with antipsychotic drugs starting from the age of 4. He has a short stature for his age, a low anterior hairline, left microtia with agenesis of the helix, bilateral preauricular tags, low set ears, long eyelashes, epicanthus, a deviated nose with a downward pointing tip, and a short neck. Skeletal anomalies were prominent and included a bifid thumb on the right hand, a long left thumb with a size and shape similar to that of the second left hand finger, and overlapping toes on the feet. VFMS was also noted to have hypospadias and a hypochromic spot on the right thigh. An abdominal ultrasound was normal. Echocardiography showed an atrial septal defect. Cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux (grade II) and bilateral reduction of the distal urethral caliber. However, blood tests results ruled out renal insufficiency, and renal scintigraphy and ultrasonography findings were normal. Analysis of auditory brainstem evoked potentials indicated bilateral moderate hearing, with better responses to low-frequency stimuli. Brain computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were normal (Fig. 1). An electroencephalogram (International 10¨C20 System of Electrode Placement), showed normal background activity. X-rays showed preaxial polydactyly with ulnar deviation (Fig. 2), and a rudimentary rib at T12."
24603435,ORPHA:861,Treacher-Collins syndrome,"Family 1. The affected individual was a young girl, born from distant cousins who originated from the region of Cappadocia in Turkey. She was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy with normal growth parameters (weight: 3,700?g; height: 52?cm; head circumference: 33?cm). Microretrognathia, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, and right-ear dysplasia with bilateral preauricular fistulae were observed (Figure 1a), but no diagnosis was proposed. When evaluated at the age of 3 years by a geneticist (B.D.), the diagnosis of TCS was suggested considering these clinical signs and the associated bilateral hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan of the skull showed bilateral hypoplasia of oval window, prolapsus of the second portion of the facial canal, and rudimentary auditory ossicles. Growth parameters were normal (at + 1SD), as were motor and cognitive development parameters. Clinical examination and radiological investigations (including skull X-rays and pantograms) of her parents and her sister were normal (Figure 1b). A maternal cousin, also born from a consanguineous union, had unilateral anotia, microretrognathism, and asymmetric mandibular hypoplasia consistent with a possible diagnosis of Goldenhar syndrome."
24603435,ORPHA:861,Treacher-Collins syndrome,"Family 2. The three affected children were born from first cousins originating from the same region of central Turkey as Family 1. The elder sister was born at term after an unremarkable pregnancy. Her development was normal during the first years of life. She came to medical attention due to progressive learning difficulties and hearing loss at the age of 8 years. A 45- to 50-dB conductive deafness was diagnosed, covering all frequencies, and magnetic resonance imaging visualized a bilateral fusion between the uncus and the hammer. Her hearing recovered completely after microsurgery. These conditions, associated with malar hypoplasia and retrognathism, led the clinical geneticist (L.V.M.) to diagnose TCS."
24603435,ORPHA:861,Treacher-Collins syndrome,"At the time of diagnosis, her 5-year-old sister was examined, and her phenotype was considered normal. Five years later, a younger brother was born with severe micrognathia, cleft palate, downslanting palpebral fissures, and marked malar hypoplasia. Conductive deafness due to major ossicular hypoplasia was severe, requiring hearing aids. His course indicated behavioral problems, and special education was needed. When molecular investigation of recessive TCS became available, the family was reevaluated. Surprisingly, craniofacial dysmorphism and hearing loss were also observed in the allegedly normal sister, compatible with a TCS phenotype."
26915616,ORPHA:85448,AGel amyloidosis,"A 58-yr-old Korean male presented with involuntary facial twitching and weakness, loose skin, and a deep-furrowed tongue. The symptoms had been slowly progressing since he was 54 yr old. The patient¡¯s mother, maternal uncle, and two sisters suffered from the same symptoms (Fig. 1A). This Korean family has no non-Korean relatives. The proband complained of paresthesia of the right hand, intermittent cramps on the right calf, and decreased sweating on both hands. He had no oph-thalmic complaints. Neurological examination revealed mild weakness in the orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles; however, no clear motor weakness or sensory changes were ob-served in the four extremities. "
24715504,ORPHA:2588,Myhre syndrome,"This patient was born at 36th weeks gestation by cesarean for maternal eclampsia. He was the first child of a 22-year-old healthy mother and her unrelated 22-year-old husband. Family history was unremarkable. Birth parameters included length 45?cm (10¨C25th centile), weight 2,850?g (50¨C75th centile), and OFC 34?cm (50¨C75th centile), while Apgar scores were 71/85. He had generalized joint stiffness from birth. He had no feeding, sleep, urinary, or gastrointestinal problem. Early psychomotor development was normal, as the patient walked independently at 14 months without ever crawling and said first words at 12 months. He never toe-walked. Subsequently, parents noted clumsiness and poor vocabulary. At age 4 years a child neurology consultation revealed lack of coordination of fine movements in the absence of a true developmental delay and poor articulation calling for speech therapy and psychological support for the following 5 years. Education followed standard programs and his scholastic performance was always satisfying. Nonetheless, the parents were concerned about his habitus and requested many consultations without conclusive diagnosis. Heart, kidney and abdominal ultrasound, electromyography and electroneurography, brain and total spine magnetic resonance imaging, and screening for bone turnover had normal results, except for minimal liver enlargement in the absence of biochemical markers of liver dysfunction. Standard karyotype and FMR1 analyses were negative. Various standard radiographs were performed without a diagnostic impact. At age 15 years, measurements included height 163?cm (25th centile), weight 80?kg (95¨C97th centile), OFC 58?cm (97th centile), inner canthal distance 3.2?cm (50th centile), outer canthal distance 92?mm (75th centile), philtrum length 17?mm (50¨C75th centile), ear length 57?mm (?1 SD). The patient appeared athletic with a muscular built, although he did not perform intense sport activity (Fig. 1a). Arm span was proportionate to his height (156?cm), while hands were short (Fig. 1b,c), with total hand length 19?cm (3rd¨C25th centile), middle finger length 7?cm (3rd centile) and middle finger/total hand ratio 36.8% (<3rd centile). Clinical features of the patient. a: Athletic built with reduced motion at elbows. Brachydactyly at hands (b) and feet (c). Radiographs obtained at age13 years confirmed brachydactyly with predominant phalangeal involvement at hands (d) and feet (e). f: Hyperplastic vertebral pedicles. Facial dysmorphism included hypoplastic ear lobes, arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, prognathism with class III malocclusion, and protruding lips. Musculoskeletal features comprised thoracic hyperkyphosis, lumbar hyperlordosis, joint stiffness (marked at elbows, ankles and toes, and less severe at fingers, spine and knees), generalized muscle hypertonia, and absent osteotendineous reflexes. Diffuse keratosis pilaris was noted. Review of previously obtained radiographs revealed brachydactyly with predominant involvement of the phalanges compared to relatively spared metacarpals (Fig. 1d,e). Spine showed hyperplastic vertebral pedicles (Fig. 1f). Skull radiographs demonstrated a thickened cranial vault. Ophthalmologic survey had a normal result while audiometry showed bilateral conductive hearing loss."

23313286,ORPHA:98855,Autosomal recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,"Patient II3 (see Fig. 1), a female, came to medical attention at age 8 because of a 2-year history of difficulty running. Examination disclosed proximal leg weakness, ptosis, absent reflexes, absent subcutaneous fat diffusely, and increased lumbar lordosis. In addition to her ptosis, she had other distinctive features including micrognathia and a relatively aged appearance resembling mild progeria. There was no sensory abnormality or opthalmoplegia. Her ptosis and weakness did not demonstrate fatigability. Progression over the years involved worsening ptosis, increased severity of weakness in a limb girdle pattern, the development of flexion contractures at her elbows, plantar flexion contractures of the ankles and scoliosis. She developed difficult to control hypertension and hyperlipidemia in her 20¡¯s. She became wheelchair bound and required continuous positive pressure ventilation at night secondary to restrictive lung disease from scoliosis by age 30. Her distribution of weakness and contractures was similar to the classic presentation of EDMD, however cardiovascular involvement was minimal, with isolated hypertension, making this an atypical presentation of the EDMD phenotype [[10]]. On the other hand her physical features, including apparent lipodystrophy and facial features were distinct from those in most patients with EDMD."
30473892,ORPHA:397709,Intellectual disability-coarse face-macrocephaly-cerebellar hypotrophy syndrome,"The index patient (IV-1), now 6.8 years of age, was born via normal SVD at full term after unremarkable pregnancy. She first came to medical attention for recurrent chest infections since the age of 4 months. Investigations showed bronchomalacia of left main bronchus. Echocardiography showed ASD II, which was closed surgically at 6 months of age. At 20 months of age, global development delay was noticed. She could sit with support but was unable to stand or crawl and could only say a few words. Physical examination showed coarse facial features, depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism, and epicanthal folds. Neurological examination showed nystagmus, normal muscle bulk, and mild hypotonia. Epileptic seizures were not present. Power and reflexes were however difficult to assess objectively. Laboratory investigations following newborn screen, plasma amino acids, urine organic and amino acids, mucopolysaccharides, and oligosaccharides were all normal. Skeletal survey was unremarkable. Nerve conduction study was normal. MRI brain showed cerebellar atrophy more prominent in anterior vermis with asymmetric white matter volume loss (more in the left side) resulting in crossed cerebellar diaschisis [Figure 2]."
30701076,ORPHA:60030,Loeys-Dietz syndrome,"The patient was a Japanese man with no apparent relevant family history of thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or dissection. It was thought that he suffered from an MFS-related disorder because of his tall stature, thin body habitus (height, 182?cm; weight, 43.6?kg), and scoliosis at the age of 15 years. Echocardiography revealed an enlargement of the sinus of Valsalva (36?mm; aortic root Z-score4, 5.87), for which he had been followed up at a local hospital. At the age of 27 years, his aortic root diameter was 41?mm (188?cm; 50?kg; Z-score, 5.17), and he was referred to the Marfan clinic at the University of Tokyo Hospital. He had a positive wrist and thumb sign and presented with pectus excavatum, a hindfoot deformity, lumbosacral dural ectasia, protrusio acetabuli, kyphoscoliosis, facial features (dolichocephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures, and malar hypoplasia), skin striae, high myopia, and mitral valve prolapse (15 points, according to the 2010 revised Ghent nosology5). Furthermore, he had a bifid uvula, hypertelorism, tortuous cerebral arteries, and cervical spine instability. At the age of 31, his aortic root diameter was 48?mm (Z-score, 8.08), and his aneurysm was treated using the David valve-sparing root replacement procedure. Extended histological examinations revealed elastin degradation, cystic medial necrosis, and increased SMAD2 phosphorylation, indicating active TGF-¦Â signaling in the aortic wall (Fig. 1a, b)."
30759870,ORPHA:536532,Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 2,"The proband (LOVD ID AN_006205) was an Italian 53-year-old woman, born from healthy second-cousins parents, and had two healthy brothers. Clinical history was remarkable for premature birth at 30 weeks (height 44 cm, weight 1.2 kg) associated with perinatal respiratory distress. Neonatal severe hypotonia and delayed motor development, i.e., delays in walking (she took her first steps at four years of age) and acquisition of fine motor skills, were also reported. Medical history further included propensity to develop ecchymoses either spontaneously or upon minimal trauma often occurring for motor clumsiness, surgically treated umbilical hernia in infancy, myopia and astigmatism since childhood, and complete dental loss due to unspecified periodontitis at 14 years old. At age 18, a clinical diagnosis of unspecified EDS was given for gJHM, skin hyperextensibility, delayed wound healing, and easy bruising; genetic analyses were not performed. The patient suffered from recurrent dislocations of knees and occasionally of shoulders and elbows since the age of 10; the objective patellar instability was surgically treated by capsuloplasty and transposition of the insertion of the common patellar tendon by tibial tuberosity transplantation followed by skin plastic surgery at the age of 29 leading to a wide atrophic post-surgical scar (Figure 1A). At 21 and 23 years old, respectively, she underwent bilateral saphenectomy for symptomatic varicosities with pain, fatigability, heaviness, and recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis and surgical removal of nodules on vocal cords. At age 41, the patient was subjected to operative treatment of rotator cuff disease in the setting of weakness and substantial functional disability. Since age 42, she suffered from Achilles tendinopathy with pain and stiffness, especially at the back of the ankle, treated with on-demand NSAIDs use, conservative physical therapy, and orthotic insoles for severe pes planus. At 43 years of age, metatarsal osteotomy on the 3rd toe of the right foot for metatarsalgia and aggravating Achilles tendinopathy was performed. In the same period, she developed disabling bilateral gonarthrosis, treated with arthroscopic abrasion, epitrochleitis, and subacromial shoulder impingement associated with night pain. Hypotrophy of the scapular girdle and weak osteotendinous reflexes were observed at age 50, when she also experienced the dislocation of the left ankle with soft tissue effusion without reabsorption."

She was born after a normal pregnancy at full term with an uncomplicated perinatal and neonatal course. There was no history of gross haematuria or colicky abdominal pain, and she had received no medication except for antipyretics. The family history was negative with respect to renal and metabolic disease, including urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, however, genetic counselling revealed that the parents have common ancestors in the fourth generation. On physical examination the child appeared mildly dehydrated with increased body temperature of 37.6 ¡ãC. A laboratory examination found moderate anaemia (haemoglobin 93.0 g/l), leucocytosis (15x109/l) and moderately elevated CRP (42.6 mg/l). Serum electrolyte, urea and creatinine levels were normal. The calcium/creatinine ratio and 24 h calcium excretion was within the reference range. Blood gas analysis was normal with no evidence of metabolic acidosis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen raised suspicion of ureterolithiasis l.sin. Cystourethrography was indicated, showing concrement sized 2 cm x 0.8 cm in the distal part of the left ureter with mild dilatation of the renal pelvis and ureter (Fig. 1). At the age of 11 months, an ureterolithotomy was performed at the University Children Hospital Bratislava. A chemical analysis of the extracted stone was performed, and the stone was characterised as a composite of virtually pure calcium oxalate. The following course was without any complications."
30808312,ORPHA:610,Bethlem myopathy,"The patient was a 14-year-old boy born of nonconsanguineous parentage presenting with muscle weakness from 3?years of age without any family history. He presented congenitally with decreased fetal movements and mild developmental motor delay with toe walking evident. He had normal mental growth. He was observed to have slowly progressive weakness of the proximal muscles of the extremities and the axial muscles of the trunk but was still able to perform activities of daily living without assistance. At the same time, it was difficult for him to climb stairs, jump, run, and rise from the floor, but he had no respiratory dysfunction. He had hyperkeratosis pilaris on the extensor surface of the legs and arms. Six months before admission, he developed recurrent gross hematuria, three bouts in total, with the presence of blood clots in the urine. There was no history of fever, lumbodynia, urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, trauma, edema, arthralgias, or skin rashes during the disease course. On examination, respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were normal. There was follicular hyperkeratosis on the extensor surface. Tests of mental function and cranial nerves function were normal. His face, lip, tongue, and throat muscles were unaffected. His neck muscles were noticeably weak (Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3/5). The muscle weakness in the limbs was symmetrical (MRC grade 4/5 proximally and 3¨C4/5 distally) with muscle atrophy of the shoulder girdle and lower legs. His sensations were undamaged, and muscle stretch reflexes were nonexistent. Neither joint contractures nor muscle contractions were apparent apart from contracture of the ankles and pes cavus. Routine blood and stool tests were normal. Routine urine tests disclosed 3823 urinary red cells/¦ÌL and 16 red cell casts/¦ÌL. Proteinuria was 187.60?mg/day, and blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate were within the normal range. Urine red blood cell phase demonstrated that 80% of the urinary erythrocytes were abnormal. Cystoscopy was performed with no abnormal signs other than some blood clots. Abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated no abnormal signs."

The older patient (P1) was born at term by C-section because of severe fetal distress. P1¡¯s weight was 2,315 kg (less than third percentile), length was 48 cm (10th percentile), and head circumference was 35 cm (50th percentile). Short limbs and scaphocephaly were apparent. Mechanical ventilation was necessary because of respiratory distress. Laryngotracheal narrowing was found on laryngeal endoscopy, abdominal sonography revealed the presence of multiple liver cysts, and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging showed impingement of the posterior arch of C1 on the medulla with mild stenosis of the cervical canal requiring neurosurgery. Over the first months of life, short-limbed dwarfism (length at age 4 mo less than third percentile) became evident. The patient developed Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus sepsis at 3 mo and generalized exfoliating dermatitis at 5 mo (Fig. 1 A). Immunological evaluation at that time demonstrated that >97% of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ cells had an activated/memory (CD45RA?) phenotype. Maternal T cell engraftment was ruled out by microsatellite analysis, and oligoclonality of circulating T cells was demonstrated by heteroduplex analysis of T cell receptor ¦Â variable (TCRBV) gene rearrangement PCR products. TCR excision circles (TRECs) at that time were undetectable (normal value: >41/?l). Neurological abnormalities included opisthotonus with generalized hyperreflexia, generalized seizures, and absence of any interaction with the environment. The infant deceased at 11 mo of age after a history of recurrent infections."

She also presented with respiratory distress; short limbs were apparent, as was a cloverleaf skull deformity (Fig. 1 B); there was also anal atresia, for which a colostomy was performed in the first days of life. Imaging studies revealed the presence of multiple premature craniosynostoses, a malformation of the craniocervical junction with narrowing of the cervical canal and a thin cord, and the presence of multiple liver cysts. Clonic arm movements and nystagmus were interpreted as seizure equivalents, and developmental delay was ascertained. After multiple infections and seizures, the patient died at 7 mo of age. TREC and control genomic DNA were quantitated from the recovered newborn dried blood spots of P2 and a control infant born the same day; whereas both samples had detectable actin control copies (though lower than in samples stored desiccated at ¨C20¡ãC), TRECs were present in the control DNA but absent in DNA from P2."

She was ascertained after positive newborn screening for SCID (T cell excision circles, TRECs of 12/?L blood, with the normal range being >25/?L; control actin copy number was normal). In addition, she had marked skeletal dysplasia and developmental delay. Her facial features (Fig. 1 C) demonstrated hypotonia and long and up-slanting palpebral fissures, simple ears, and a small chin. She had wide-spaced nipples and a pectus excavatum, short limbs with extra skin folds at the shoulders and elbows, a severe thoracic scoliosis and lumbar lordosis, a left single transverse crease, brachydactyly of the halluces and fifth toes, and two elbow dimples bilaterally. Her tone was markedly reduced, but there were no other neurological findings. In her first year of life, she had severe failure to thrive and required high calorie supplements and tube feedings with a G-tube. Metabolic assessment demonstrated hypertriglyceridemia. A magnetic resonance image of the brain and spine at 8 mo of age showed platyspondyly, lordoscoliosis, and pear-shaped vertebral ossification. No vertebral segmentation defects were identified. She had hypoplasia of the posterior C1 arch with narrowing of the cervical spinal canal and cord compression requiring neurosurgery. She was diagnosed with esotropia and chronic blepharitis with recurrent bilateral chalazion. Radiographs of the spine at 2 yr of age confirmed platyspondyly of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with increased loss of vertebral height compared with disc spaces and progression of the thoracolumbar kyphosis to 90 degrees. A pelvic radiograph showed bilateral coxa vara, dysplastic changes of both hips, and subluxation of the left hip. When last examined at 2 yr and 5 mo of age, she was able to reach for objects, roll over, sit with support, and had several single words. Her height was 74 cm (?4.18 SD), her weight was 7.173 kg (?6.84 SD), and her head circumference was 46 cm (¨C1.87 SD). Spontaneous, partial improvement of immune function was observed at 1 yr and 4 mo of life. At that time, administration of intravenous immunoglobulins was suspended, and production of specific antibodies was observed in response to both killed/recombinant and live vaccines.
